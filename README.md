# Equities
This repository is for projects related to equities, futures, and options. Please refer to each project's respective `.md` for more information.

## Disclaimer
This is **not** financial advice and I am **not** a financial advisor. Most of this is purely introductory knowledge, and is certainly not enough to make a living trading stocks. Investors do lose money trading, and you should do so at your own risk. The projects here can handle and analyze real data, but they are intended for academic (theoretical or coding) purposes. You should be aware of the risks involved in investing and/or trading. You will use the material in this or any of my [other repositories](https://github.com/uigc?tab=repositories) at your own risk. I cannot guarantee the accuracy or validity of my work when applied to real-world investing and/or trading.
